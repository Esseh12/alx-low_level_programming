# Project: 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
### Introduction
Search algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science, used to locate specific data within a collection of data. Understanding different search algorithms allows us to efficiently retrieve information from large datasets. This project explores various search algorithms in C, including linear search and binary search, and discusses how to determine the best search algorithm based on specific needs.

## Tasks
### Linear search

### Big O #2
Determine the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.
### Big O #3
Determine the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.
### Big O #4
Determine the space complexity of the allocate_map function.
Understanding Search Algorithms
Search algorithms are methods for finding an element within a collection of data. Linear search examines each element in the collection sequentially until the target element is found or the end of the collection is reached. Binary search, on the other hand, works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found or the interval is empty. By understanding the characteristics and complexities of different search algorithms, we can choose the most appropriate algorithm for specific use cases, optimizing efficiency and performance.
