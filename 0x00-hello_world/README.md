# C Programming Directory

This directory contains C programming source code and related files. It is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the C source code files.
- `include/`: Contains header files.
- `bin/`: Contains compiled executable files.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc) with the following command:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89


## Additional Notes

- Make sure you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
